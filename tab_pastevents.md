### Thursday, 28th November 2019

**Location:** Dell Technologies, City Gate, Mahon, Cork.

**Time:** Doors Open at 6pm for registration, pizza, drinks and networking, the talks start at 6:30pm (we start on time).

**Talk:**
-  Multi Factor Authentication the false narrative
   - Darragh Duffy & John O'Riordan

   - John is a Staff Cyber Security Engineer, Qualcomm
- An Insider's Guide to Hacking Your Network
  -  Mark O'Sullivan
  -  Penetration Testing, Cyber Risk, Deloitte


**Multi Factor Authentication the false narrative**

John and Darragh will talk about some of the miss conceptions with 2FA/2SV/MFA as the perfect mechanism to protect our identities. They will discuss some of these additional authentication factor mechanisms (SMS tokens, One Time Passcodes etc.) and if they are really a second factor. They will highlight the major weakness with how we perceive and use 2FA/MFA mechanisms. They will demonstrate how you can exploit this weakness, bypassing the protection we believe 2FA/MFA offers us. They will finish up by introducing the current solution to this MFA weakness, FIDO2, which is a true MFA mechanism but not yet widely adopted.
