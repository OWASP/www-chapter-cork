**Multi Factor Authentication the false narrative**

John and Darragh will talk about some of the miss conceptions with 2FA/2SV/MFA as the perfect mechanism to protect our identities. They will discuss some of these additional authentication factor mechanisms (SMS tokens, One Time Passcodes etc.) and if they are really a second factor. They will highlight the major weakness with how we perceive and use 2FA/MFA mechanisms. They will demonstrate how you can exploit this weakness, bypassing the protection we believe 2FA/MFA offers us. They will finish up by introducing the current solution to this MFA weakness, FIDO2, which is a true MFA mechanism but not yet widely adopted.
